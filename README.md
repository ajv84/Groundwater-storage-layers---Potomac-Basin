# Data for Evaluating Time-lagged Relationships between Groundwater Storage and River Discharge: Case Study of the Potomac Basin
This repository contains the datasets used in the above-titled study published in Environmental Research Communications.

## Files
- `gws_perc_0125deg_US_[date].tif`: Weekly groundwater storage percentile maps used in the study, organized chronologically beginning in April 2002. The numeric string in each filename indicates the corresponding date (e.g., 20020401 = April 1, 2002). Additional data and maps are available at nasagrace.unl.edu through a partnership with the National Drought Mitigation Center.
- `Discharge`: This folder contains time series discharge data recorded at 15-minute intervals starting from April 2002.
- `Catchment Boundaries`: Contains shapefiles used to delineate catchment areas. These were applied to filter the gridded GWS data to specific hydrologic units.
